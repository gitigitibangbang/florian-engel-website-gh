Hi!
My name is Florian Engel.

During the day I run a digital agency called more onion. At night I study and learn (really I just break things) in a never ending quest to reach the point in live where I feel like I actually know what I'm doing.

Over the years our company has turned into more of a startup incubator / accellerator with a social conscience, with offices in London, Berlin and Vienna. Throwing out new products as well as improving our existing tools for digital campaigning & online fundraising is a fun habit that also pays the rent.


My short verison of a CV is:
* Bored of reading or writing CVs (2015-now)
* Co-founder of [more onion](http://www.more-onion.com), design & strategy lead, general manager (since 2009 - now)
* Product manager of [Campaignion](http://www.campaignion.org), a tool for digital campaigning and online fundraising (2012-now)
* Public Speaker (2010-now)
* Strategist, consultant for eCampaigning and Digital Fundraising (2010-now)
* Designer, UX designer, Front-End Developer (2008-2013)
* Spent a year in Auckland, New Zealand (2007)
* Got into activism and campaigning at high school (student union) (2004)


Some of my qualifications are:
* Agile management (Some experience with XP, Kanban, iterative delivery, managing teams)
* Product management, in particular getting minimal viable products out the door
* Building user centred products through basic UX and design thinking
* Crafting brands and marketing strategies
* Designing landing pages, websites and interfaces
* Online Campaigning strategy, online fundraising and digital marketing
* Front End Development (otherwise I couldn't really design a website, could I?)
* 

At this point I'm just running out of fancy buzz-words to label what I do.

According to a Nigerian oil exporter I'm an "agitator".
I'm wearing this badge with pride ever since. But really, I just believe in very basic, sound ideas like social justice, not wracking the enviroment, not being a racist biggot, gender equality and... you know... human decency. I've really not done anything to deserve the beautiful label agitator.


One of my passions is to use digital tools and new forms of organising to make an impact. 

Yes, I also design interfaces, landing pages and craft brands at times. Does that make me a graphic designer?
I know how to use front end development and my understanding of User Experience and Information Architecture is just about enough to get by. Both of these skills make a semi-decent web designer, so I guess that's what I am 20% of day my job.
