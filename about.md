Hi!
My name is Florian Engel.

During the day I run a digital agency called more onion. At night I also run a digital agency called more onion.

Over the years it has turned into more of a startup incubator / accellerator with a social conscience. Throwing out new products and improving our existing tools for digital campaigning and online fundraising has turned into a habit that also pays the rent.

I'm an activist with a passion to use digital tools and new forms of organising to make an impact. I believe in very basic ideas like social justice, not wracking the enviroment, not being a racist biggot and gender equality.

At this point I'm just running out of francy expressions to label what I do.
Yes, I design interfaces, landing pages and craft brands at times. Does that make me a graphic designer?
I know how to use front end development and my understanding of User Experience and Information Architecture is just about enough to get by. Both of these skills make a semi-decent web designer, so I guess that's what I am 20% of day my job.

Qualifications are:
* Agile
* Building user centred products
* 

According to a Nigerian oil exporter I'm an "agitator".
I wear this badge with pride ever since. If you think about it I've not really done much to earn it though. All ever did was start an argument with a business man on a train ride to Brussels.
