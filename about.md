My name is Florian Engel. You could probably have guessed that from the title.

During the day I run a digital agency called [more onion](http://www.more-onion.com). At night I ~~break things~~ study and learn in a never ending quest to reach the point in live where I feel like I actually know what I'm doing.

Over the years our company has turned into a number of startups, with offices in London, Berlin and Vienna. Throwing out new products as well as improving our existing tools for digital campaigning & online fundraising is a fun ~~obsession~~ habit that also pays the rent.


My short verison of a CV is:
* Bored of reading and writing CVs (2015-now)
* Co-founder of [more onion](http://www.more-onion.com), design & strategy lead, general manager (since 2009 - now)
* Product manager of [Campaignion](http://www.campaignion.org), a tool for digital campaigning and online fundraising (2012-now)
* Public Speaker (2010-now)
* Strategist, consultant for eCampaigning and Digital Fundraising (2010-now)
* Designer, UX designer, Front-End Developer (2008-2013)
* Spent a year in Auckland, New Zealand (2007)
* Got into activism and campaigning at high school (student union) (2004)


Some of my qualifications are:
* Agile management (Some experience with XP, Kanban, iterative delivery, managing teams)
* Online Campaigning strategy, online fundraising and digital marketing
* Product management, in particular getting minimal viable products out the door
* Building user centred products through simple UX, user research, user testing and "design thinking"
* Designing landing pages, websites and interfaces
* Front End Development (otherwise I couldn't really design a website, could I?)
* Crafting brands, bringing communications & marketing strategies to life


At this point I'm just running out of fancy buzz-words to label what I do.

According to a Nigerian oil exporter I'm an "agitator".
I'm wearing this badge with pride, it's really quite flattering. But the truth is, I just believe in very basic, simple and sound ideas like social justice, not wracking the enviroment, not being a racist biggot, gender equality and... you know... human decency. I've really not done anything serious enough to earn it.
